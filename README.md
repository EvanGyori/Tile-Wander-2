# Tile Wander 2
Put this project onto github for the purposes of archiving old projects. Made in 2018.

Only works on windows.

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to learn C++ classes by remaking a console game that I [previously made](https://github.com/EvanGyori/TileWander) in C++ and to tidy up the game.

Procedurally generated console turn based game. Kill enemies to collect better weapons and loot.

## Usage
Create a build directory and run cmake from the build directory
```
cmake <project-source-directory>
cmake --build .
```

Creates an executable called `TileWander2`.
